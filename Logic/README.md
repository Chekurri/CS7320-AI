# Chapter 7-9: Knowledge-based Agents

While first-order logic is often performed using 
the dedicated logic programming laguage [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog), Python provides
several modules for logic and symbolic mathematics. Here is a 
short primer for [Logic Programming with Python.](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/artificial_intelligence_with_python/artificial_intelligence_with_python_logic_programming.htm).

Pretrained large language models can be used via an API or run locally.

* [OpenAI Python API Library.](https://github.com/openai/openai-python)
* [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) provides a large collection
  of downloadable pretrained LLMs with 
* [Prompt engineering guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) from OpenAI.
