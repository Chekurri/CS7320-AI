# HOWTO Work on Assignments

You can either download individual assignment notebooks or clone the complete repository using
```
git clone https://github.com/mhahsler/CS7320-AI
```

The assignments are improved frequently, so always `pull` the latest version before you start to work on a new assignment. 

```
git pull --ff-only
```

If you want to use work on the assignment using version control, then create a new **private** repository and check your code in there. 

Your assignment notebooks needs to be a complete project reports with 

- documentation (including your design choices), 
- code (with comments for difficult to understand sections) and
- results (e.g., tables with simulation results) with a short discussion of what they mean. 

Use the provided notebook cells and insert additional code and markdown cells as needed.
