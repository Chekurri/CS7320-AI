# HOWTO Work on Assignments

We will provide you with a CoLab link to the assignment notebook.

* **Option 1:** You can work directly on CoLab by using `File>Save a copy to Drive`(you will need a Google Account).
* **Option 2:** You can download individual assignment notebooks using `File>Download>Download .ipynb` and then work locally on the project.

Make sure that you have a copy of your assigment in a save place that has a backup (e.g., Google Drive).
If you want to use work on the assignment using version control, then create a new **private** repository and check your code in there. 

Your assignment notebooks needs to be a complete project reports with 

- documentation (including your design choices), 
- code (with comments for difficult to understand sections) and
- results (e.g., tables with simulation results) with a short discussion of what they mean. 

Use the provided notebook cells and insert additional code and markdown cells as needed.
