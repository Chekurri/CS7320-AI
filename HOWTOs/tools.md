# HOWTO Tools

## Installing Python and Jupyter Notebook

You can experiment with the code online without installation using 
[Google CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mhahsler/CS7320-AI/).

To work on assignments, you can use one of several environments: 
* Use the online service [Google CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com). No additional installations are necessary.
* Install Visual Studio Code. It will prompt you to install all needed software when you open a notebook file.
* Install Python, [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) and all needed packages yourself using `pip` or `conda`. You can
also use [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) for easier installation.

## Learning Python and Jupyer Notebook

If you are not familiar with Python, then you should work through one of the many Python tutorials (e.g., [this tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)) to learn the basics about Python and the packages `numpy` and `pandas`. Some code examples that help with the assignments are available [here](.).

How to use Jupyter notebooks is covered in many online tutorials like the [Jupyer notebook tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/).
